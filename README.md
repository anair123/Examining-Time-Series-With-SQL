# Examining-Time-Series-With-SQL

This project entails navigating the times series of vaccinations of the countries in UK using SQL Server. With SQL queries, we are able to determine variables such as % change in monthly vaccinations and identify the countries with the least successful and most successful vaccination programs. 

For an in-depth coverage of the analysis as well as an explanation of the queries used, check out this link: https://towardsdatascience.com/navigating-time-series-with-sql-39068018ba7e
